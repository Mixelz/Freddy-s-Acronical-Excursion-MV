so here's how you sync and shit
when you make changes, they show up in the changed file area
(it takes long the first time because it's every file but later it's only gonna be named by individual stuff)
when you do a commit that's basically a change
summary and desc are basically to say what you changed when you did the commit
now after you commit, you have to go on "fetch origin"
this pushes the commit to the online git thing
when you make a commit fetch original becomes "push origin"
meaning it pushes your files to the original
if you don't have any files to push, it says fetch
which basically means retrieving files from the origin
so basically to do the syncing thing to someone else, you commit to master, go on push origin, 
then once it's done for you they have to fetch origin so your files go to them
then they have the same thing
got all that?

also so commits don't intefere with each other and shit
you should probably have one person work in MV(that project alone ofc) at a time(edited)
though if you really want to
say
have one person work on skills while the other does enemies
there would be a solution
when you're both about to commit(after working on the shit)
one person copies over their file and sends it over to the other person
and the first person discards the change on their end
and then the other person commits and syncs and whatever
