Each Era has their own set of shit, such as common events, skills, etc.

You must keep your shit in your section, or things'll get fucked when it's time to combine.

For voice lines, make sure it's [YOUR ERA] Person - voice line. If a line is used in a different era, rename
[YOUR ERA] into [FAE] so that we know it's not only used for your era.

You have resources to get started with your era. If you have a problem, ask TOMASU (TOMBSDAY) so that he can help.

Make sure that at the completion of your era, you add a completion star with a switch "ERACompletion" in your
era section for switches. Same with 100%ing the era, "ERA100%" It should mostly be at the end of all your
switches.

You also got variables too, so don't worry about that either.

If you have problems with an actor having the wrong scream animation, just
make your own scream skill with the correct animation, and put <Replace Attack: x> in the notes of your actors.
